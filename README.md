# laravel-chirper

## Starting the project

Docker is required.

Run `./vendor/bin/sail up` for starting the server.

Run `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` for starting VITE.

## View the project

Just enter http://localhost/ in the browser after running `./vendor/bin/sail up` and waiting until it's initialized.

## Run commands

Use `./vendor/bin/sail <command>` to run a command in the container.

Example:

View PHP version: `./vendor/bin/sail php --version`

List Artisan commands: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan list`

View Composer version: `./vendor/bin/sail composer --version`

View Node Package Manager version: `./vendor/bin/sail npm --version`

## SQL database default credentials

Connecting your SQL Management Software using localhost with the default username: `sail` and password: `password`.

## List Routes

You may view all of the routes for your application by running the `./vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list` command.

## Execute code

You can execute code and methods to test them and see the results easily with Tinker:

`./vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker`

This will open a CLI to run your commands. For example:

`App\Models\Chirp::all();`

This command will run the `all` method from the `Chirp` class, which lists all the Chirps from the database.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
